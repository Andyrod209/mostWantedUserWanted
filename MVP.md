Goal: You have been contracted to build a prototype for a person search application for a top-secret
government project. You have been given access to an array of objects representing individuals. The 
prototype should just use prompt() and alert() for the User Interface (UI). Although this isn’t typical in 
production, you may use only two files for this project, an HTML file and a JS file for the application.
Technologies: JavaScript
User Stories:

(5 points): As a developer, I want to make at least 15 consistent commits with good, descriptive 
messages.

<!-- (5 points): As a developer, I want to run validation on any user input, ensuring that a user is re-prompted when they provide invalid input. -->

<!-- (10 points): As a user, I want to be able to search for someone based on a single criterion
- You should be able to find and return a list of people who match the search -->

<!-- (15 points): As a user, I want to be able to search for someone based on multiple traits (up to a 
maximum of five criteria at once).
- i.e., if you search for Gender: male and Eye Color: blue, you should get back a list of people who 
match the search. In this case, it will be only people who are male with blue eyes. -->

<!-- (10 points): As a user, I want to be able to look up someone’s information after I find them with the 
program (display values for the various traits of the found person). -->

<!-- (15 points): As a user, after locating a person, I want to see only that person’s descendants (display the 
names of the descendants). -->

<!-- (15 points): As a user, after locating a person, I want to see only that person’s immediate family 
members, displaying the names of the family members and their relation to the found person. 
- i.e., parents, spouse, siblings -->

Bonus

<!-- As a user, after locating a person, I want to see only that person’s descendants (display the names of the 
descendants), using recursion -->



My To-Do list:
<!-- Get info/family/descendants buttons to work -->
<!-- -change info/family/descendants info from alerts to printing on the page -->
<!-- -add validation to input fields
-change name search so you can search by first name or last name individually -->
-Improve styling
<!-- -fix bug: prints all names when no search terms set -->
-fix flex-box 
-style validation?
-fix refresh issue
<!-- -make it so you can click on a relative and be brought to their info -->

-mayyyybe build in back button to take you back to previous list (of displayPeople). so that if there's two billy bobs and you click on one and it's wrong, you can go back and click on the other one without having to start all over again
